\section{\erlir Award Categories}
\label{sec:AwardCategories}
Awards will be given to the best teams in each of the \erlir \emph{task benchmarks} and \emph{functionality benchmarks} that are described in Sections \ref{sec:TaskBenchmarks} and \ref{sec:FunctionalityBenchmarks}. 
For every local/major tournament, and for every task and functionality benchmark, a score is computed by taking the median of the best (up to 5) trials. The final end of year score is computed by taking the median of the pooled trials that were used for scoring the best two Local/Major tournaments and teams are ranked based on this score.
The \erl Competition awards will be given in the form of cups for the best teams. Every team will also receive a plaquette with the \erl logo and a certificate.

Please note that teams need to participate in a minimum of two tournaments (Local and/or Major) per year in order to obtain a  score for the TBMs and/or FBMs that they intend to enter.

%\erlir competition awards will be given in the form of cups for the best teams, as specified below. Every team will receive a plaquette with the \erlir logo and a certificate.
%Awards will be given to the best teams in \erlir \emph{task benchmarks}, \emph{functional benchmarks} and overall.

\subsection{Awards for Task Benchmarks}
\label{sec:AwardTBMs}
The team with the highest score in each of the three \emph{task benchmarks} will be awarded a cup (''\erlir Best-in-class Task Benchmark <\emph{task benchmark} title>'').
When a single team participates in a given \emph{task benchmark}, the corresponding \emph{task benchmark} award will only be given to that team if the Executive and Technical Committees consider the team performance of exceptional level.

\subsection{Awards for Functionality Benchmarks}
\label{sec:AwardFBMs}
The teams with the highest score ranking for each of the three \emph{functionality benchmarks} will be awarded a cup (''\erlir Best-in-Class Functionality Benchmark <\emph{functionality benchmark} title>'' and '\erlir Second-Best-in-Class Functionality Benchmark <\emph{functionality benchmark} title>'').
When less than three teams participate in a given \emph{functionality benchmark}, only the ''\erlir Best-in-class Functionality Benchmark <\emph{functionality benchmark} title>'' award will be given to a team, and only if the Executive and Technical Committees consider that team's performance as excellent.

%The two top teams in the score ranking for each of the three \emph{functionality benchmarks} will be awarded a cup (''\erlir Best-in-class Functionality Benchmark <\emph{functionality benchmark} title>'' and ''\erlir Second-Best-in-class Functionality Benchmark <\emph{functionality benchmark} title>'').

%When less than three teams participate in a given \emph{functionality benchmark}, only the ''\erlir Best-in-class Functionality Benchmark <\emph{functionality benchmark} title>'' award will be given to a team, and this will occur only if the Executive and Technical Committees consider that team's performance as excellent.

%\subsection{Competition Winners}
%\label{sec:AwardOverall}

%Teams participating in \erlir competitions will be ranked taking into account their overall rank in all the \emph{task benchmarks}.
%\todo{LaberLaberLaber entfernen}
%The overall ranking will be obtained by combining task benchmark rankings using the Social Welfare principle (see \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_welfare_function}); the overall winning team of \roaw Competition 2015 will be the top team in this combined ranking, and will receive the corresponding award cup (''Best Team \roaw Competition 2015''). The second and third placed teams in the ranking will also receive award cups (respectively ''2nd place \roaw Competition 2015'' and ''3rd place \roaw Competition 2015'')).
%The three awards will be given only if more than 5 teams participate in the competition. Otherwise, only the best team will be awarded, except if it is the single team participating, in which case the Executive and Technical Committees must consider that team performance of exceptional level so as for the team to be awarded. Only teams performing the total of the three tasks will be considered for the ''Best Team \roaw Competition 2015'' award.
